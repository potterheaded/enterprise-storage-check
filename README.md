## Usage

You can use this repository as a codespace, or locally using the following commands.

**To test Actions Artifacts and Logs:**

```
docker login ghcr.io/github-technology-partners
./ghe-storage-test.sh -p s3 -c "BucketName=github-actions-storage-test;AccessKeyId=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID;SecretAccessKey=$AWS_SECRET_KEY;ServiceUrl=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com;PathPrefix=actions-l2"
```

By default container from the latest released GHES version is used. Other version may be specified using `-v` switch, e.g. `-v 3.2`
